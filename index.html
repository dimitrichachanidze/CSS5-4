                            Nestled at the foot of Mount Snowdon, the highest mountain in Wales, this hostel has a rich
                            history tied to mountaineering and the great outdoors. Originally built as a coach inn in
                            the late 1800s, it served travelers journeying through the rugged terrain of Snowdonia.
                            What makes Pen-y-Pass special is its role in outdoor culture. Over the decades, it became a
                            base for legendary climbers who tackled the Snowdon Horseshoe—a challenging circuit of
                            ridges—and contributed to the development of modern mountaineering in the UK.

                            Located in a beautifully preserved Victorian mansion built in 1885, the HI Sacramento Hostel
                            offers a glimpse into the grandeur of California's past. Originally the home of a wealthy
                            gold prospector, the mansion later became a boarding house and eventually a hostel. Its
                            elegant architecture, complete with stained glass windows, carved wooden staircases, and
                            period furnishings, makes it a unique blend of history and hospitality.

                            Once a courthouse in the heart of London, Clink78 Hostel is steeped in history. Built in the
                            19th century, the building was where Charles Dickens worked as a court reporter, inspiring
                            elements of his famous novel Oliver Twist. In the 20th century, it served as a magistrates'
                            court and famously hosted trials for punk bands like The Clash. Today, the hostel preserves
                            its legal heritage—guests can stay in refurbished prison cells and relax in the
                            courtroom-turned-lounge.
